    It's holiday TV movie season, and it's not just a Hallmark party. There's also Lifetime, UPTV, and — increasingly — Netflix.

    We know that for devotees of this genre, it can be hard to keep up. Therefore, we have prepared a helpful guide to all the new movies we're aware of that are on tap for the season, complete with notations for which tropes they offer. Everything in bold is what I would consider an element of holiday programming; that should help you find what you need. Are you a person who likes to see a "suit man" learn the new meaning of Christmas? We can help! Do you prefer to see someone save her hometown? You'll find just the right movie for you, right here. And remember: These are just the new ones. There are so many!
    
    I've also noted where beloved celebrities and nostalgic figures are present — I admit this is a blurry line between these categories, but it's meant to be "famous for [specific character/project]" versus "famous generally."

    Note that these are based on what the networks and services have revealed thus far. Some of these might have hidden elves or moppets or musical numbers that just haven't revealed themselves yet. You have to keep some surprises for Santa, right?
    
    Ho-ho-ho.
    
    Picture A Perfect Christmas (Hallmark, 11/9, 8 pmET)

    Keshia Knight Pulliam plays a DJ who is forced to relocate from her Philadelphia broadcasting digs to the small town of — you guessed it — Bethlehem, and it turns out this little town is OK. Also, everybody cares too much about Christmas, in that there is apparently a "year-round Christmas station." (You can kind of forgive them because it's Bethlehem, I suppose.)
    
    Rock N' Roll Christmas (UPTV, 11/10, 7pmET)
    
    Estranged mother and daughter singers rush to get ready in time to write a Christmas single together. Will they succeed? I would say it's fa-la-la-la-likely. There's probably music!

    Lifetime
    
    Christmas in Louisiana (Lifetime, 11/16, 8 pmET)
    
    Well she's a former Miss Christmas in her town, a title that exists because everybody cares too much about Christmas, and she goes back home and runs into the former Mister Christmas, and they might perhaps fall in love and presumably wear matching wreath crowns.

    Write Before Christmas (Hallmark, 11/17, 8 pmET)
    
    A woman sends thank-you notes at Christmas. The most important thing to know about this one is that nostalgic figure Grant Show, former Melrose Place hottie, is now playing Hot Gray Hair types, and it's possible that he looks better than ever. Here, most of his scenes seem to be with a cute dog. Also beloved celebrity Lolita Davidovich. Horrible pun title.
    
    Random Acts of Christmas (Lifetime, 11/17, 8 pmET)
    
    An investigative journalist (not sure if she's grumpy) tries to figure out why there are "random acts of Christmas" taking place. A man "ignites her Christmas spirit."

    The Knight Before Christmas (Netflix, 11/21)
    
    If you were a medieval knight and you were magically transported to Christmas in contemporary Ohio, wouldn't you hope to run into Vanessa Hudgens? Sure you would. So would this guy, and it happens to him thanks to the actual supernatural force of time travel. Horrible pun title.
    
    The Magical Christmas Shoes (Lifetime, 11/22, 8 pmET)
    
    This is not the same movie as The Christmas Shoes, based on the book The Christmas Shoes which was based on the song "The Christmas Shoes." No, this is The Magical Christmas Shoes, and it's something else entirely, but it appears to involve actual supernatural forces.

    So there's a woman in event planning who has to plan a Christmas wedding, which is pretty hard.

    Cherished Memories: A Gift to Remember 2 (Hallmark, 11/24, 8 pmET)
    
    Look, I could explain this movie to you, or I could tell you that the first sentence of the description is "A year after Darcy ran over Aiden, his amnesia is gone but not their love." (Darcy is also trying to save the rec center, meaning this is also an example of saving her hometown).
    
    Christmas 9 to 5 (Lifetime, 11/24, 8 pmET)
    
    Tiya Sircar (who plays Vicky/"Real Eleanor" on The Good Place) plays a grump journalist (she might be more of a hopeful journalist, but it's not clear) who's assigned to find the true meaning of Christmas, so she becomes a sales clerk.
    
    A Christmas Duet (Hallmark, 11/25, 8 pmET)
    
    Averie and Jesse used to be a singing duo until they broke up, but now he, her old flame, comes to her lodge (a/k/a her adorable small business) over the holidays, and naturally they may just figure out how to get back together. They are played, we should note, by Chaley Rose and Rome Flynn, black leading actors on a channel that basically never used to have black leading actors but has some this year; Lifetime has significantly more and has for quite a while. There's probably music!
    
    Wes Brown and Rachel Boston canoodle in Check Inn To Christmas.
    Fred Hayes/Hallmark Channel
    
    Check Inn To Christmas (Hallmark, 11/26, 8 pmET)
    
    Her family and his family own rival cozy inns (what could be a more adorable small business?) and might just fall in love even though they are professional competitors. Nostalgic figure Richard Karn! Horrible pun title.
    
    A Very Vintage Christmas (Lifetime, 11/27, 8 pmET)
    
    Tia Mowry-Hardrict is in this one about a woman who owns the ultimate adorable small business: an antique shop. She comes into possession of a box of someone's old stuff (which cannot really be that uncommon, given that it's an antique shop) and decides to return it. A man helps her, obviously.
    
    The Christmas Club (Hallmark, 11/27, 8 pmET)

    A Christmas Wish (Lifetime, 11/28, 8 pmET)
    
    It's not clear whether this movie about a woman who makes a wish for love really gets the wish via actual supernatural forces or whether she only thinks she's getting the wish when actually she's not getting the wish but just falling in love the regular way, but I'm throwing it in here anyway.
    
    Christmas at the Plaza (Hallmark, 11/28, 8 pmET)

She gets a special assignment from a guy who doesn't feel prepared to decorate his own house for Christmas but thinks his daughter would enjoy it. And then she teaches everybody the true meaning of Christmas, probably. (He is not a suit man; he is a sweater man, which is a very different man.)
    
    Christmas In Evergreen: Tidings Of Joy (Hallmark, 11/29, 8 pmET)
